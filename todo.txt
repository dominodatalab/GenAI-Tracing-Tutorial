# TriageFlow Project Status
# Last updated: 2025-12-23

## COMPLETED
- [x] Set up TriageFlow multi-agent incident triage system with 4 agents
- [x] Integrated Domino GenAI tracing (notebook demo working)
- [x] Created judge experiment infrastructure (run_judge_experiment.py)
- [x] Created ground truth labels for all 4 verticals (ground_truth_judgments.yaml)
- [x] Ran judge optimization for financial_services (100% agreement, binary scale best)
- [x] Ran judge optimization for healthcare (100% agreement, binary scale best)

## IN PROGRESS - Judge Experiments

### Next Commands to Run:
```bash
python scripts/run_judge_experiment.py --vertical energy --model gpt-4o-mini --runs-per-config 2 --submit-job
python scripts/run_judge_experiment.py --vertical public_sector --model gpt-4o-mini --runs-per-config 2 --submit-job
```

## REMAINING TASKS

### High Priority
- [ ] Run judge experiments for remaining verticals:
  - [x] financial_services (DONE - 100% agreement)
  - [x] healthcare (DONE - 100% agreement)
  - [ ] energy
  - [ ] public_sector

### After Judge Experiments
- [ ] Run local model optimization (once Qwen endpoint verified)
  ```bash
  python scripts/run_local_optimization.py --vertical healthcare --submit-job
  ```

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Set up guardrails call
- [ ] Create separate demo app
- [ ] Have judge evaluations run on a schedule (not as part of production app)

## KEY FINDING
Binary scale significantly outperforms three_point scale for judges.
Best config so far: gpt-4o-mini, temp=0.0, direct prompt, binary scale
