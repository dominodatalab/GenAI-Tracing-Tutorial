    This ground truth dataset covers regulated industries with varying 
    incident types. Use for:
    1. Judge validation (Phase 2) - compare judge output to human_labels
    2. Agent evaluation (Phase 3) - compare agent output to expected_classification
    
    Edge cases included:
    - Time-bounded urgency (deadlines, market hours)
    - Compliance vs security distinction
    - Infrastructure vs performance distinction  
    - Context-dependent urgency (election timing, market hours)
